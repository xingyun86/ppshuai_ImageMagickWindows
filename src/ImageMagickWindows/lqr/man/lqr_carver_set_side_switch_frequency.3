.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
When the function
\fBlqr_carver_resize\fR(3)
is invoked, it computes a relevance value for each pixel in the image, then chooses the optimal seam to carve based on such relvance values\&. However, in the case two seams are equivalent (which may happen when large portions of the image have the same colour, for example), the algorithm always chooses the seams from one side\&.
.PP
In order to overcome this effect, an option is given to automatically switch the favoured side during rescaling, at the cost of a slightly worse performance\&.
.PP
The function
\fBlqr_carver_set_side_switch_frequency\fR
sets the side switch frequency to
\fIswitch_frequency\fR
for the
LqrCarver
object pointed to by
\fIcarver\fR\&. This will have the effect that, for each rescale operation, the favoured side will be switched
\fIswitch_frequency\fR
times (or as much times as the number of pixels to rescale)\&.
.PP
The default value for newly created
LqrCarver
objects is
0\&.
.PP
As for the final result, a very small value (e\&.g\&.
1 to 4) will normally suffice to balance the left and right side of the image (or the top and the boddom sides for vertical rescalings), without noticeable computational costs\&. However, in order to obtain a smoother behaviour for the visibiliy map, i\&.e\&. for the intermediate steps, higher values may be required\&.
