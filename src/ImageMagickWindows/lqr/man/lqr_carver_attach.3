.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The function
\fBlqr_carver_attach\fR
is used to attach an
LqrCarver
object (pointed to by
\fIaux\fR) to another one (pointed to by
\fIcarver\fR)\&. This will have the effect that each operation performed over the
\fIcarver\fR
object will be reflected on
\fIaux\fR
(they will share the same visibility map)\&.
.PP
This function must not be used after a visibility map was loaded into the base object (the one pointed to by
\fIcarver\fR)\&.
.PP
The object pointed to by
\fIaux\fR
must have the same original size as the base object\&. Note that the original size information is reset whenever a flattening operation occurs, or the rescaling direction changes, so that this function should be called befor rescaling occurs\&.
.PP
There is no limitation on the number of
LqrCarver
objects which is possible to attach\&. Nesting is also possible\&. It is irrelevant if the
\fIaux\fR
carver is initialised or not; from the moment of attachment, it will passively undergo all transformations performed over
\fIcarver\fR\&.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
The return value follows the Liquid Rescale library signalling system\&.
\fBLQR_ERROR\fR
is returned if the sizes of
\fIcarver\fR
and
\fIaux\fR
don\'t match\&.
